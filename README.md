#  Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset.

##  Files in this Repository

- `EDA_Titanic.ipynb` â€“ Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `Survival_prediction.ipynb` â€“ Notebook for building and evaluating prediction models
- `titanic_train.csv` â€“ Dataset used for training and validation
- `titanic_test.csv` â€“ Provided in the repository but **not used** in this project

##  Note

Although both `titanic_train.csv` and `titanic_test.csv` are included in the repository, **only the `titanic_train.csv` file has been used**.  
We split it into training and validation sets using **Scikit-learnâ€™s `train_test_split`** method.  
The `titanic_test.csv` file has **not been used** in any analysis or prediction.

## Key Components

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified missing values and patterns
- Explored relationships between features and survival
- Used visualizations to gain insights (e.g., Seaborn, Matplotlib)

### Model Building
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Built basic models like Logistic Regression
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and other metrics

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Status

ðŸš§ This project is **in progress**. We are still:
- Exploring and analyzing the dataset further
- Trying to derive more insights and values from the data
- Working on making additional predictions, such as predicting missing ages and other features
